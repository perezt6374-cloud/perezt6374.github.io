    <h1>This is about Bartholamule Allen's Origin</h1>

    <p>
        Barry Allen is a forensic scientist known for being slow and often late. One night, a lightning bolt causes chemicals to spill on him, giving him super speed and reflexes. Inspired by his childhood hero, Jay Garrick, Barry becomes The Flash, Central City's crimefighter. His costume, designed by Ira West, includes a ring that stores and releases his suit, and he invents the cosmic treadmill for time travel.

        Barry is highly respected among speedsters and admired by heroes like Batman. After his death in Crisis on Infinite Earths, Barry's essence travels back in time, becoming the lightning bolt that transforms his past self into The Flash.

    <p>
        In The Flash: Rebirth, it’s revealed that Barry’s mother was murdered and his father wrongly imprisoned. The villain Professor Zoom caused much of Barry's personal tragedy, including the murder. Barry and Wally West eventually confront Zoom, breaking the time barrier and stopping Zoom from killing Barry’s fiancée, Iris.
